# LaTeX Template

## Template file for LaTeX documents (excluding Beamer)

Macros, packages, and extra commands are defined and imported in macros.tex and others.  
The file main.tex contains the starts of the document, importing macros and other commands.
Added a Makefile for quick compiling with bibtex and cleaning the extra files created during compiling.
